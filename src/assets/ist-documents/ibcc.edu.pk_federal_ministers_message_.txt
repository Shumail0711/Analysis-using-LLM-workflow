Education is the basic right of every child and a very important aspect for progress of any nation. In the modern era no nation can survive without quality education. Human Resource Development is the central pillar of the government policy and education plays a fundamental role towards the formation of human social capital. All the organs of Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training, Islamabad are playing their role to this effect according to their respective mandates. I feel Inter Boards Coordination Commission has been contributing with due mission and vision mandated to it. After visualizing its achievements within the sphere of its mandate, I feel that IBCC has been moving towards right direction with a capable team to cope with its official obligations fairly, to be kept up with same zeal.
