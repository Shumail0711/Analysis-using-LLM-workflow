For this purpose, Universities, Professional Colleges and Organizations where such certificate holders take admission or job respectively, their documents can get verified through IBCC. IBCC does not verify the documents to third party where the purpose of verification is unknown, therefore, the organization who wants to verify the credentials/documents should clearly mention the purpose.

IBCC will verify the documents on submission of prescribed fee of Rs: 600/- per certificate and Rs. 300/- on account of courier charges. Online Fee challan form is available on IBCC’s website.
