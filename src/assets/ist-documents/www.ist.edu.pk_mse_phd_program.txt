The PhD program is designed to give students a broad and deep understanding of materials. The specialized research oriented coursework and quality thesis will allow students to build their career in aerospace materials, nanotechnology, smart materials and coatings & tribology. The key objective of the PhD degree program in Materials Science & Engineering (MSE) is to impart rigorous training for undertaking challenges in innovative research which is publishable in globally benchmarked high quality journals and conferences. The graduate students are expected to study and collaborate with faculty members in an open dialogue oriented explorative atmosphere (mostly informal but intellectually rewarding) compared with a structured and defined curriculum of undergraduate study. Generally, faculty members conduct research in different specialities of MSE that allow student to choose a research topic from a spectrum of research fields and then excel in them under the individual supervision and guidance of a faculty member. The program is designed for full-time students who under ideal circumstances will complete the different phases of coursework, qualifying examinations, and doctoral dissertation, and publish their work in an ISI indexed journal in 4-5 years of uninterrupted study. The curriculum is designed to provide interdisciplinary training that combines advanced fabrication methods with the latest techniques in materials processing and engineering. The choice of courses is tailored to the student's professional objectives and must meet the minimum requirements of the IST. The courses are selected and approved in consultation with the DBGS at the time of giving admission. Departures from the stated requirements are considered only in exceptional cases and must be approved by Graduate Studies and Research Council (GSRC). Research areas are numerous and include aerospace materials, nanotechnology, smart materials and coating & tribology. To fulfil the minimum requirement of 18 credit hours of course work, students have to take a mandatory course in aerospace materials and five other courses from the list of PhD courses approved by DBGS for each student. A course that is part of MS degree curriculum will not be made part of PhD coursework. Moreover, a student must pass a non-credit course of “Research Methodologies” if not already studied during the MS coursework. $committee comprises of one internal (field experts in the department) and two external examiner (field expert in any other HEC recognised Institute).
