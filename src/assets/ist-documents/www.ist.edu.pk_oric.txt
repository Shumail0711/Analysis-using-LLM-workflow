Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization (ORIC) was established at Institute of Space Technology (IST) under the aegis of Higher Education Commission (HEC) in June 2011. ORIC is mandated to manage and advance the university’s strategic initiatives around Research and Development (R&D). The office oversees a variety of functional areas, such as, Research Operations & Development, University-industry Linkages, Professional Development, Intellectual Property Rights, Business Incubation and Technology Transfer. ORIC has been focusing to create an enabling environment for IST students, faculty and researchers to conduct world-class research, accomplish Industry-focused projects, translate academic research into products and services, and commercialize IP. ORIC also serves as the point of contact for National R&D organizations, Other Academia, Industry, National and International donor agencies to foster stakeholder collaboration for joint R&D initiatives.
