System reliability has gained significant importance with the ever-increasing cost and complexity of engineering system design. The critical components must demonstrate high degree of reliability under given operating conditions to function. A formal assessment of reliability becomes necessary whenever the risks or costs of failure are high. Reliability cannot generally be forecast accurately, and reliability measurements can at best be made within statistical limits imposed by the experimental data. For engineering industries relying on complex engineering systems, predictive maintenance and remote diagnostic tool are a priority. The reliability risks are controlled by imposition of design rules and reliability centric maintenance. Visit to leading research center may be arranged to have practical understanding of reliability engineering. Participation in this course will lead to reduction of plant breakdown and will lead to productivity enhancement.
