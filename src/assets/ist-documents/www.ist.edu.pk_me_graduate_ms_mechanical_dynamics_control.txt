Dynamics and Control aims to introduce the concepts of mathematical modelling, simulation, underlying forces and control theory to measure the performance of the multifaceted engineering systems. Further, it provides to examine or improve the dynamic response with the aid of control strategies for stabilizing the complex and unstable systems. Dynamics and Control is primarily focused by combining a variety of interesting fields such as nonlinear dynamics, mechatronics, robotics, dynamics of plates and shells, rotor-dynamics, control of mechanical systems, and acoustics etc. Specific areas of interest include: Students will acquire an exposure to analyze the real dynamic systems, identify or evaluate the system parameters, stability requirements, and the control schemes to regulate them. In nutshell, Dynamics and Control is a multi-disciplinary area in which students will be able to model and solve the dynamical complex systems in a variety of disciplines such as mechanical, aerospace, electrical, avionics, biological and so forth.
