To the North of Islamabad, Margallah lies between the ancient capital of Gandhara (Taxila), and Islamabad. There is an obelisk right on the top of the Pass, built in 1890 in memory of Brig Gen of the British army, by his colleagues. A small part of the ancient Shahi (Royal) Road built by Chandar Gupta and later developed by the Afghan King Sher Shah Suri in 1540s, can also be seen.
