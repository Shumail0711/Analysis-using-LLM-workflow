Professor/Head of Department PhD University of Glasgow, UKArea of Specialization:DynamicsHEC Approved Ph.D Supervisor92.51.9075477asif.israr@ist.edu.pk Prof. Dr. Asif Israr received his Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK in 2008. His research focused on the modeling, design, and analysis of cracked structures in response to vibration input. His research resulted in several conference and journal papers of international repute. He won several research grants from HEC-NRPU and R&D Organizations. He is with the Institute of Space Technology (IST) since 1999 and performed extremely well in all key positions. At present, he is the Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering. His research interests include linear and nonlinear modeling of dynamical systems, applied mechanics, methods of approximate analytical solutions to ODE-based models, application of the principles of nonlinear dynamics to problems in structural vibration, energy harvesting, finite element analysis, and renewable energy. He is actively involved in a new concept of developing energy through wind, the development of metamaterials for low-frequency noise control, and shock energy absorbing devices. Other than academics, he is one of the pioneers in the establishment of IST, founder of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and its infrastructure, and the Centre for Vibration Testing and Condition Monitoring (CVCM).
