IST is now offering Bachelors program in Computer Science from Fall 2020 at IST main campus Islamabad. Computer Science is the most saught-after degree these days and student's premier preference. IST has done the necessary homework to make it a very competitive program. Related research labs like Cybersecurity Lab, Artificial Intelligence & Computer Vision Lab (iVision) have already been established. The curriculum of Computer Science is designed to provide in-depth knowledge about the field of computing and related interdisciplinary areas. The students will be able to gain practical knowledge and hands-on experience in the areas like artificial intelligence, image processing, mobile application development, big data analytics, social network analysis, computer architecture and Internet of Things (IoT). The program of computer science will allow the students to involve themselves in the solution development of the real-world problems and open the opportunities for the students as potential candidates for private or public sector organization, freelance developers and entrepreneurs.
