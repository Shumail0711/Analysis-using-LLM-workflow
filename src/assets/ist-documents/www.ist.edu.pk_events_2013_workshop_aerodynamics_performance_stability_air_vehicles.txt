The primary focus of this course is to get deep-insight into aerodynamics, performance and stability of high speed vehicles. The course aims to deliver methodologies to mitigate dynamic instability and gust effects at high Mach number, and to compute the aerodynamic performance. Workshop will be conducted from 22nd July to 26th July For more information please download the brochure below.
