The purpose of Failure Analysis is to analyze the fracture features and to attempt to relate the topography of the fracture surface to the causes and/or basic mechanisms of failure. Different modes of crack growth produce distinct characteristic features on the surface, which can be used to help identify the mode of failure. This course is intended to provide a practical understanding of the topic based upon theoretical knowledge of concepts that are involved in the failures of engineering materials along with a practical edge to interpret features of fracture surfaces with the help of various industrial failure case studies.
