Space is the final frontier and space science is becoming exceedingly important with each passing day, while Physics is one of the most important fundamental science that has applications in all spheres of science and technology. Our BS Space Science program has specializations in Remote Sensing & Geographical Information Science, Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Environmental Science; all of which have market demand and plenty of opportunities for higher studies. Our BS Physics program caters for areas that have demand and applications in computational physics, material physics, quantum physics, plasma physics, high energy physics, electronics, optics, astronomy and astrophysics. Our graduate programs include MS and PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics as well as MS in Remote Sensing & Geographical Information Science (RS GISc). The department has highly qualified faculty with significant international collaborations and well-equipped facilities that bring strength to our BS, MS and PhD programs.
