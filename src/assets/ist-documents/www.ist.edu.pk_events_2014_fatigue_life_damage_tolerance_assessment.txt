The purpose of Life Assessment of structural components is to avoid catastrophic failures and to maintain safe and reliable functioning of equipment in the industry. This course is intended to provide a practical understanding of the topic based upon theoretical knowledge of concepts that are involved in the Life assessment methods with the help of various case studies. It would allow the participants to understand the structural design process, and how analysis of structural components integrates into determination of remaining life, fitness-for-service, and other life assessment concerns. Dr. Fahim Hashmi (PhD Materials Science and Engineering) is the Founding Director of Failure Analysis Center at IST, Islamabad. Prof. Dr. Syed Wilayat Husain PhD (Metallurgy), UConn. Specialized Areas: Alloy Development, Materials Characterization.
