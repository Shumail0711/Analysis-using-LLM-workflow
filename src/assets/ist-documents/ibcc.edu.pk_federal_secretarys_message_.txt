Education is as much a philosophical undertaking braced by social as well as educational values, as it is a technical operation executed by an executive body of experts and professionals. IBCC is thus uniquely mandated as a body that serves as a high-value forum for consultation and exchange of ideas by all the Education Boards of the country on all important matters related to the development and promotion of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education. Ministry of Federal Education & Professional Training is cognizant that assessments and examinations carry supreme importance in developing learners to be able to negotiate the challenges of modern-day global education and to become responsible citizens. IBCC is making a significant, ongoing contribution through efficient advisory for defining standards and practices for Education Boards. This is a great contribution by IBCC to human resource development through reflecting on effective design, delivery, and promotion of a wide range of high-quality, affordable assessments and examinations executed by Education Boards in Pakistan. The government of Pakistan is on the mission to achieve excellence and equity for all the children and youth in Pakistan. Collectively, we are committed to every student having equal access to education opportunities no matter their background or circumstance.
