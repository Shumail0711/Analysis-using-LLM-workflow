This course is designed for Maintenance and Design Engineers who want to apply modern vibration analysis techniques and principles for early fault detection and damage prevention in critical costly industrial machines. VA-II builds upon the foundation of the ISO 18436.2 Cat-2 Standard course. The course covers advanced techniques of data acquisition and signal processing, waveform analysis, spectral diagnostics, phase analysis, single-channel impact testing and field balancing. The VA-II course will help the plant maintenance engineers in selecting an optimized vibration monitoring program in their plants.
