The Department of Applied Mathematics & Statistics was established at the Institute of Space Technology (IST) in September 2014. Academic programs and their curricula are designed per the guidelines of the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan to align with modern technologies to bridge the applied and engineering disciplines so that an interdisciplinary research culture may prevail. Data Science and Artificial Intelligence are emerging fields that are integral parts of our undergraduate program. This would help train the students to excel in the fields of new and innovative technologies. This distinguished feature of the department is indeed a modification in the conventional graduate degree programs offered anywhere else. This would help in strengthening the mathematical as well as interdisciplinary foundations of the students. This would train students to make them highly marketable in view of modern challenges and requirements.
