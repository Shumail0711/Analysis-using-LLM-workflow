Ever since the establishment of this institution, our primary goal for undergraduate students is to train future leaders with high-quality engineering education. The aim of department of Mechanical Engineering is to disseminate knowledge and technologies through quality teaching, research and its applications in mechanical and allied disciplines. In our creative and attractive curriculum, we strive to assimilate the latest developments in mechanics, dynamics, thermo-fluid, energy, and manufacturing. Our dedicated faculty graduated from world renowned universities grows our leading-edge research programs in dynamics, energy, thermo-fluids, design & manufacturing, and control etc. We strive to ensure that all our young students have a strong education with leadership, management and teaming skills, internship experience, and involvement in student activities. We entrust that accentuating these areas will make our young students well-qualified to take leadership roles in the future. Mechanical engineers develop state-of-the-art technologies and exhilarating solutions for the mankind. We attempt to provide our students with a cheerful, productive and satisfying experience at all levels of their program of studies to explore the amazing world of mechanical engineering. With this, we welcome you all to Mechanical Engineering at the Institute of Space Technology. Dr. Asif Israr Head of Department
