The Department of Mechanical Engineering provides a firm foundation in basic sciences, mathematics and design methodology in the area of mechanical structures, fluids, manufacturing and thermal systems. Engines, ships, train, air & space vehicles, steam & gas turbine, machine tools, robots etc are a few systems and devices that need the knowledge of mechanical engineering. The curriculum includes the methodological tools, innovative thought, communication skills, management tools, and provide students the opportunities to work efficiently as individuals and in teams. In the senior year of the program, students are required to apply the theoretical knowledge to real world problems and gain hands-on engineering experiences that require problem designing, team work, communication, time management and economic analysis. The department encourages students to pursue internships that link academic knowledge to lifelong work experiences. The department also offers the opportunity for the students to participate in professional societies such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) and American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics (AIAA) etc. The reason for offering mechanical engineering is to prepare students for a wide range of exciting industrial opportunities including aerospace, manufacturing, automotive, chemical, biomedical, nuclear power, robotics, and textiles. Mechanical Engineers can find employment in the field of research & development, production & manufacturing, design, operation & maintenance, and administration.
