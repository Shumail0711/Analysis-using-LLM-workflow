Radio Astronomy is a sub-branch of astronomy in which the nature, origin and properties of celestial objects, astronomical events and phenomena, astrophysical processes and mechanisms are studied at radio wavelengths using various kinds of radio telescopes. The primary difference between other branches of astronomy (e.g. optical/infrared) and radio astronomy is that the equipment, instruments and the observational setup used for radio astronomy is very similar to the one which would be used for radio science and engineering. The elements of the radio observation system broadly include radio antennas, receiver systems, signal acquisition and processing chain, I/O systems and a data storage, processing and analysis system. The entire facility where the radio observation system is installed and deployed is known as a radio observatory or a radio astronomy facility.
