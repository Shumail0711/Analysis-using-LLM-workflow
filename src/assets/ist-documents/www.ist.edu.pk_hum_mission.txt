The Department of Humanities & Sciences promotes a holistic approach to science within the broader context of its human and social implications by providing the conceptual, theoretical and philosophical background needed to sensitize learners to cross-disciplinary perspectives. Our goal is to develop cognitive skills that allow students to engage in critical reflection, impactful communication, and socially responsible action on the professional and personal level in a manner that upholds our ethical, human intellectual and Islamic heritage.
