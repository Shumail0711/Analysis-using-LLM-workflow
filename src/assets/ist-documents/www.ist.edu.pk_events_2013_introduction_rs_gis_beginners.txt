Recent advances in Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques and availability of satellite data at affordable cost have provided an opportunity to acquire the needful information in many application fields at spatial and temporal scales. Satellite data and GIS are being used in various fields of applications including, but not limited to, environmental studies, urban and regional planning, geology, agriculture, energy sector, natural disaster management, natural resources conservation, information technology, health sciences, and retail and marketing. The objective of this workshop is to impart knowledge about RS and GIS techniques to the beginners through lectures and hands on exercises using commonly used software. The workshop participants will be able to apply this knowledge in their specific fields.
