Pakistan is one of the developing countries of the 21st century with enormous potential for scientific advancement. In the recent past the Government of Pakistan has made effort in this regard. The Higher Education Commission (HEC) has recently made a concentrated effort to promote science at the tertiary level, the positive results of which have already begun to materialize. The Planning Commission of Pakistan is one of the governmental bodies run by the top scientists of Pakistan dedicated to R&D. Pakistani universities are also playing an important role of producing scholars and future leaders in the front echelon of their respective fields. In lieu of this commitment to science, The Institute of Space Technology (IST) Islamabad, is hosting a series of workshops on September 8, 2012. The workshops will provide an opportunity for young students of science to witness first-hand the new vistas of R&D being explored by Pakistani scientists. There will be 5 presentations, each focusing on a key area of research in space technologies and renewable energy sources.
