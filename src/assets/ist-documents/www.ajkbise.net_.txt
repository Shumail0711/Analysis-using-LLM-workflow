Prof. Nazar Hussain Ch. It has been a great honour for me to become head of an institution that follows a completely transparent and computerized examination system by the grace of Allah Almighty. All the departments are well aware of their duties. The dedication and determination of both technical and non-technical staff is quite impressive. The knowledge based understanding of the employees regarding rules and regulations of examination is excellent. My main objective is to preserve and prosper the on going system of the organization in such a way that it becomes more strengthened and modernized. While on the other side I have plans to facilitate people as much as possible keeping the sanctity of the rules making more positive changes in the system. I am also very keen to improve the standard of education and provide comfortable environment for everyone who likes to get the light of education. I am sure that the new generation is quite energetic and enthusiastic and if given positive directions they can make us feel proud. I feel that the talented people must be encouraged and appreciated and talent must get its reward. I have also invited the experienced technical professionals of my organization to come and share their ideas to find new paradigms for betterment of education and I am also very willing to convert any positive idea into reality by the grace of Allah Almighty.
