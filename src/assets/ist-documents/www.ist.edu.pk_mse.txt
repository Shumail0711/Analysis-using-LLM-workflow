The Department of Materials Science & Engineering is a hub of research and teaching, supported by state of the art laboratories & equipment. The research facilities are regularly being utilized not only by our own students but also by students coming from universities spread over all the four provinces, including Gilgit Baltistan & Azad Kashmir. Courses are designed to impart the fundamental concepts on one hand and their specialized applications in metals and alloys, ceramics, polymers and composites on the other. Diversification in specialties is the strength of our faculty; energy harvesting and storage, micro/nano electronic devices, optoelectronics, bio-inspired nanostructured materials, electroactive materials and multifunctional materials, to name a few. The department is proud to uphold the tradition of strong linkage with the industry as well as with the R&D organizations, where a good percentage of our graduates serve.
