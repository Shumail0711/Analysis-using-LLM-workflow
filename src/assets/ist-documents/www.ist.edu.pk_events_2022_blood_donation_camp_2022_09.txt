The 9th Blood Donation Camp is planned to be held on 09-June-2022 (Thursday) from 1000 to 1600 hours at IST (Venue: Block-I (Old Library Hall) IST Main Campus). All students and employees are requested to participate in this esteemed cause and help saving lives. Family members or relatives of any student or employee can also volunteer for blood donation. The Blood Bank of IST is maintained at AFIT (Armed Forced Institute of Transfusion) Rawalpindi. Eight Blood Donation Camps have been organized by IST since 2009. By the Grace of Almighty Allah, this has helped all the IST Students, employees of IST, SPARCENT and their family members to save many precious lives. Hemoglobin Test and Blood group tests shall be carried out before donation. Furthermore, every single donation is also screened for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV etc. This will also help the donors in timely diagnosis of illness (if any). Every time you donate blood, someone else can celebrate life.
