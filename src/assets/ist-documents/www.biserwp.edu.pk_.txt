It gives me immense satisfaction that Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Rawalpindi is extending its services to the public by opening a new IT based window. The Government of the Punjab is endeavoring a lot to up-lift education in the province. The quality of education is an integral part of it. The access of candidates, parents, academicians or even general public to the rules and regulations and facilities being provided at Boards, will help to achieve the target of better examination system and establishing its integrity. It is a matter of great privilege and pride for me to be heading the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Rawalpindi at a time when the Board is making things more efficient by harnessing the power of technology. While we continue to affect improvements in the examination on the whole, especially in terms of smooth conduct of examinations and timely announcement of results, we are equally alive to the importance of making things more accessible to all stakeholders. This website is just a demonstration of the same. May Almighty Allah give us strength to serve the nation better. (Notification)
