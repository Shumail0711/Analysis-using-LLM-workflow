A collection of research journals that are categorized into three different categories – W, X and Y -- within their respective knowledge areas on the basis of a number of internationally benchmarked and recognized parameters that measure the quality of a journal. The relative position and category of each journal is computed by a proprietary algorithm that is designed with the objective of promoting quality research across various disciplines. HJRS uses a novel Journal Prestige Index (JPI) measure which is calculated as a function of a journal's internationally benchmarked and recognized prestige parameters. The relative thresholds, decided by the respective scientific review panel of HEC, on JPI are used to classify Journals into W, X or Y categories. All six factors are given equal weight to ensure that no bias is introduced towards any single factor. HJRS includes all the subject areas and sub-categories according to JACS. This provides precise and fine-grained positioning of a journal at two different levels: within a top-level subject area and different sub-categories within a top-level subject area. As a result, the quality parameters that associate a bias with any subject area are normalized relative to the parameters of the journals of a subject area. HJRS reports raw and the percentile score of parameters and Journal Prestige Index (JPI) that are used for calculating the relative position of a journal to ensure transparency in assigning a category and medallion to a journal. The relative scores allow researchers to compare the quality of a journal in a Subject area and its associated sub-categories with the respective journals of the same area. HJRS categorizes a research journal into three categories – W, X and Y-- where W is the highest recognized category followed by X and Y within each subject area and its associated sub-categories.
