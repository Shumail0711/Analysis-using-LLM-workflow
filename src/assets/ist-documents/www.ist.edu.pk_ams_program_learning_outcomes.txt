The curriculum for MS/PhD students is designed by the collaboration of mathematicians and engineers. Students undertaking research in this department will have a chance to learn not only the fundamental courses of engineering but also advanced courses related to their area of specialization and interest. Emerging specializations in the domain of engineering, like Nonlinear Dynamics, Computational mathematics and Cryptography, will be offered as area of research for graduate students at this department. As AM&S is also working as supporting department for other engineering and sciences department so upon successful completion of the courses taught by mathematics faculty, students will be able to:
