This intensive workshop/ course about ‘Control Systems Design and Analysis’ describe the time-domain system characteristics based on differential equations. This focuses on the compensator design for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems. In addition to controller synthesis by pole-placement method, it will cover the optimum design using LQR methods, and linear matrix inequality based control design. The course illustrates the use of state-space methods in system analysis and design using real-world application examples drawn from aerospace, electrical, mechanical and mechatronics systems such as spacecraft, aircraft, ground/ marine and dynamic systems.
