Objective:- This course aims to guide engineers in the industry and academia to perform basic Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing at manufacturer’s premises. EMC Testing & Analysis (February 13-15) Where Excellence Meets Compliance Introduction:- Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is the branch of electrical engineering concerned with the unintentional generation, propagation and reception of electromagnetic energy which may cause unwanted effects such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) or even physical damage in operational equipment. In all advanced countries of the world compliance to EMC Tests is a mandatory requirement for all Electronic / Electromechanical products, if these have to be marketed. Full scale EMC testing is a cost exorbitant and time extensive activity. However, some tests can be performed at the manufacturer’s premises to ascertain basic level compliance. This is referred to as pre-compliance testing. This course will primarily focus on teaching Pre-Compliance level testing, troubleshooting of EMI problems & good design practices for EMC Compliance. One complete day will be dedicated to carrying out practical tests in IST EMC Test Facility.
