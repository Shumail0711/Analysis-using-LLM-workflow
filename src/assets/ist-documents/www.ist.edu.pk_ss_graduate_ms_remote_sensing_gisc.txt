In order to bring Pakistan at par with developed nations, education and research in emerging fields of science and technologies is of fundamental importance. Geospatial science and technologies including GISc, RS and associated disciplines have emerged as “enabling discipline” having applications in almost every domain. Institute of Space Technology (IST) started MS in RS & GISc in 2010 at National Centre for Remote Sensing and Geoinformatics at Karachi. In view of the growing importance of the discipline and scarcity of universities offering degree programs nationally, IST has taken yet another step forward and started MS in RS & GISc at Space Science (SS) Department at IST Islamabad Campus since 2013. The SS department gathers best foreign qualified faculty and ensures to create top quality RS & GISc human resource.
