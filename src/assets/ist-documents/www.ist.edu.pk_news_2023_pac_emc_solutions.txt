"EMC Solutions," the newly established EMC test facility within the Avionics Engineering Department, recently hosted a delegation from the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC). This visit proved insightful as the PAC team, accompanied by representatives from EMC Solutions, undertook a comprehensive tour of the testing facility situated at IST. Air Commodore Sardar Ahmed and Air Commodore Irfan Majid facilitated an in-depth overview of the EMC lab during an informative briefing session. Following this, Lab Engineers Bilal Ahmed and Maha conducted a hands-on demonstration, effectively showcasing the facility's robust capabilities. Their demonstration was enriched by the technical expertise contributed by Lab Technicians Waseeq and Farhan. Post the demonstration, a formal meeting was convened to deliberate and finalize the terms and conditions for mutual cooperation between PAC and EMC Solutions. The meeting centered on cultivating a collaborative partnership aimed at fostering mutual growth and support between both entities.
