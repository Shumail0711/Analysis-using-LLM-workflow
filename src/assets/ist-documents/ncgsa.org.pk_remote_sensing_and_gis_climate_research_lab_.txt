University of the Punjab, Lahore The Remote Sensing, GIS and Climatic Research Lab (RSGCRL), University of the Punjab, Lahore shall promote and facilitate education, research activities and collaborations to study and develop GIS and Space Applications with particular emphasis on sustainable development in Pakistan, and cost-effective tools for developing world. The research and development activities of the lab will contribute towards sustainable development in Pakistan through (i) Developing a broader analytical base from ground and satellite data for an effective and informed decision making for professional institutions and policy makers, and (ii) Designing and developing efficient and cost-effective GIS and Space Applications for climate change analyses, and (iii) Building professional and academic capacity for adaptation/mitigation/prevention strategies to combat climate change, and (iv) Increasing research and development activities through collaborations with national and international professional organizations Tools, technologies, and scientific approaches related to GIS and Space Applications would be utilized Domain 1 – Atmospheric Reactive and Greenhouse Gases To monitor atmospheric reactive and green-house gases, their transport, and assess their impact on climate change. Domain 2 – Urban Planning and Solid Waste Management Urban planning with particular emphasis on solid waste management, gases emissions and their impact on ecology. Domain 3 – Land-use/Landcover To assess the Land-use/Landcover (LULC) changes, water crises, and their impact on climate change. Domain 4 – Natural and Anthropogenic Aerosols To monitor natural and anthropogenic aerosols, track transboundary aerosols, and assess their radiative impact on climate change.
