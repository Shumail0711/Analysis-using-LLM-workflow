In 2020, the Hult Prize is challenging it’s more than one million member student network across 121 countries to build bold and disruptive social enterprises with net positive environmental unit-economics that will reach a million consumers within a decade. 2020 will mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day & the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. As a consequence of Earth Day, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and other related initiatives, environmental consciousness globally is arguably greater than it has ever been. However, the natural environment itself continues to be degraded at a massive scale by human economic activity. At the Hult Prize we believe that the Earth doesn’t just need better advocates, it needs more powerful allies. We believe that the time has come for the sort of militancy that arises not from protest, but from positive capitalism. We believe the best hope for reversing environmental degradation is to harness the very forces that are causing it-capitalism.
