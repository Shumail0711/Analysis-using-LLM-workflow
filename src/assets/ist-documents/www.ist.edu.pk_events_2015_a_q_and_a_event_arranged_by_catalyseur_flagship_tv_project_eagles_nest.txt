Catalyseur is launching a new reality TV Show with the name of “Eagles’ Nest”. First promo of this program has been launched at their facebook page: . This reality show is like any other reality talent show in which people participate to show their expertise. The only thing new about this program is the idea that instead of singing or dancing skills, in this program participant(teams) will be demonstrating their innovative and entrepreneur skills. Judges, investors and the TV audience will decide who is the best innovator through voting. The winners will be given investment for running and starting their business or enhancing their business. On the request of the students Catalyseur experts will be explaining the methodology of the program at Institute of Space Technology on 11th Nov, 2015 for details download the flyer
