Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) are cutting edge physical layer technologies slated to be employed in 4G wireless cellular standards such as 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE/LTE-A), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) and high speed WLAN standards. Such 4G cellular standards are envisaged to support data rates in excess of 100 Mbps through OFDMA, MIMO, dynamic carrier aggregation and thus enable a diverse plethora of applications in the wireless ecosystem such as broadcast/multicast video, HDTV on demand, high speed internet access, interactive gaming amongst others. At the same time there is a tremendous effort towards fixed mobile convergence to enable seamless mobility across future WLAN and cellular networks. Such factors are driving the wireless telecommunication designers and operators to invest heavily in the development of OFDM compatible technologies and applications with the aim of tapping into the potentially vast revenue opportunity in futuristic 4G cellular networks. This course is intended to provide practicing engineers, telecom teachers and graduate students in wireless with an in depth exposure to MIMO, OFDM in addition to introductory tutorials on the upcoming wireless cellular standards of LTE and WiMAX. The modular approach provides the participants with a comprehensive treatment of several aspects of the latest wireless standards and technologies while emphasizing both the theoretical and practical aspects of such systems. The initial modules will familiarize the participants with an overview of wireless communications and provide a detailed expose of MIMO, OFDM and OFDMA. This will be followed by individual modules on LTE, WiMAX elaborating several aspects of these 4G standards. A MATLAB demonstration module will introduce the participants to the practical implementation aspects of such MIMO, OFDM systems.
