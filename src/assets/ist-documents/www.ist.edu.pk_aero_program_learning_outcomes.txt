The Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics has developed Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) that are supported by our defined Program Educational Objectives. These Program Learning Outcomes relate to the aptitude, awareness and performance that the students acquire with the progression of the program. The following are the PLOs for Aerospace Engineering Program: Engineering Knowledge: An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering fundamentals and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering problems Engineering Problem Analysis: An ability to identify, formulate, research literature and analyze complex engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics, natural sciences and engineering sciences Design or Development of Solutions: An ability to design solutions for complex engineering problems and design systems, components or processes that meet specified needs with appropriate consideration for public health and safety, cultural, societal, and environmental considerations Investigation: An ability to conduct investigation into complex problems using research based knowledge and research methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of information to provide valid conclusions Modern Tool Usage: An ability to create, select and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools, including prediction and modelling, to complex engineering activities, with an understanding of the limitations. Engineer and Society: An ability to apply reasoning informed by contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practices Environment and Sustainability: An ability to understand the impact of professional engineering solutions in societal and environmental contexts and demonstrate knowledge of and need for sustainable development Ethics: An ability to apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of engineering practices Individual and Team Work: An ability to function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse teams and in multi-disciplinary settings Communication: An ability to communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the engineering community and with society at large, such as being able to comprehend and write effective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations, and give and receive clear instructions Project Management: An ability to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of engineering and management principles and apply these to one’s own work, as a member or leader in a team, to manage projects in multidisciplinary environments Life Long Learning: An ability to recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to engage in independent and life-long learning in the broadest context of technological change without disturbing the balance of life
