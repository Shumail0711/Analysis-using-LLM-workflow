Materials Science and Engineering (MS&E) has played a pivotal role in the technological evolution of our society, from structural steels to optoelectronics and information processing. The field of MS&E is currently evolving at a more rapid pace than at any point in history. The evolution of the field, and its societal impact, continuously occurs through collaborations between materials scientists/ engineers and a researcher from fields such as biology, medicine, physics, chemistry and other areas of engineering and manufacturing. Most fields in science and engineering are concerned in some way with materials, but only the field of materials science and engineering focuses directly on them. Further, the major problems in making nanotechnology based devices are material related. So a wide variety of opportunities await the materials science and engineering graduate in research, development, design, production, and management in almost every industry.
